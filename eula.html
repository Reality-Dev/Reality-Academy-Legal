<p>This End User License Agreement (“<strong>EULA</strong>”) is a legally binding contract between:</p>
<ul>
<li>the individual or legal entity that purchases, downloads, accesses, installs, or uses the Assets (“<strong>you</strong>” or “<strong>End User</strong>”); and</li>
<li>Reality Academy LLC (“<strong>Licensor</strong>,” “<strong>Reality Academy</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” or “<strong>us</strong>”).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>By clicking “I Agree,” checking an “I Agree” box, or by downloading, accessing, installing, or using any Assets, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this EULA.</strong> If you are accepting this EULA on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have authority to bind that entity, in which case “you” and “End User” refer to that entity.</p>
<p>If you do not agree to this EULA, you must not download, access, install, or use the Assets.</p>
<h2 id="definitions">2. Definitions</h2>
<p>For purposes of this EULA:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Assets”</strong> means any digital products, course materials, source code, templates, libraries, documentation, media, videos, lesson plans, examples, exercises, or other downloadable or streamable items that Reality Academy makes available under this EULA.</li>
<li><strong>“Project”</strong> means an End User’s product, service, or internal deliverable that incorporates the Assets as a component but does not consist primarily of the Assets and does not allow a third party to access the Assets on a standalone basis.</li>
<li><strong>“Educational Use”</strong> means using the Assets (or any substantial portion or derivative) to teach, train, instruct, demonstrate, display, perform, or otherwise provide instructional or pedagogical value to any third party. This includes use in courses, workshops, bootcamps, tutorials, coaching programs, certification programs, corporate training programs, or any similar offering, whether paid or free, live or recorded, public or private.</li>
<li><strong>“Competitive Offering”</strong> means a product or service whose primary purpose is to provide course content, templates, libraries, or instructional materials that are substantially similar to, substitute for, or compete with the Assets or course offerings marketed and sold by Reality Academy.</li>
<li><strong>“AI Training”</strong> means using, uploading, submitting, or otherwise making the Assets available to train, fine-tune, evaluate, benchmark, improve, or generate outputs from any machine learning or artificial intelligence model, including as part of datasets, embeddings, retrieval corpora, prompt libraries, or automated generation workflows that could retain, reproduce, or memorize the Assets.</li>
<li><strong>“Consumer”</strong> means an individual acting for purposes wholly or mainly outside that individual’s trade, business, craft, or profession, where applicable law grants that individual special consumer protections that cannot be waived by contract.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="license-grant">3. License Grant</h2>
<p>Subject to your timely payment of all applicable fees and your continued compliance with this EULA, Licensor grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable license to:</p>
<ul>
<li>download, install, and use the Assets; and</li>
<li>incorporate the Assets into your Projects,</li>
</ul>
<p>solely for your own personal use or for your own internal business purposes, and strictly in accordance with the restrictions set out in Section 4.</p>
<h2 id="restrictions">4. Restrictions</h2>
<h3 id="no-redistribution-or-resale-of-assets">4.1 No redistribution or resale of Assets</h3>
<p>Except as expressly permitted in this EULA, you may not sell, sublicense, distribute, share, rent, lease, lend, publish, provide hosted access to, or otherwise transfer the Assets (whether in original or modified form) to any third party.</p>
<h3 id="no-raw-or-extractable-access">4.2 No raw or extractable access</h3>
<p>You may not incorporate or deploy the Assets in any Project or environment in a way that allows third parties to access, download, or extract the Assets on a standalone basis. For example, you must not ship the Assets as source files, templates, libraries, or other components that can be directly accessed, copied, or repurposed by third parties.</p>
<h3 id="modifications">4.3 Modifications</h3>
<p>You may modify the Assets solely as necessary to incorporate them into your Projects in accordance with this EULA. Any modification or derivative work of the Assets remains subject to this EULA and is owned by Licensor to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, with you receiving only the license rights expressly granted here.</p>
<h3 id="educational-use-restriction">4.4 Educational Use restriction</h3>
<p><strong>You may not use the Assets for Educational Use without a separate written license from Reality Academy.</strong> This includes, without limitation:</p>
<ul>
<li>using the Assets as course content, exercises, or examples in any class, training, or workshop;</li>
<li>recording or streaming the Assets (or substantial portions of them) as part of video lessons or webinars;</li>
<li>providing copies of the Assets (or substantial derivatives) to students, trainees, or coaching clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>For clarity, this restriction does <em>not</em> prevent you from using the Assets to learn or to improve your own skills, nor does it prevent you from using the Assets internally within your own organization for internal training of your employees.</p>
<h3 id="competitive-offerings">4.5 Competitive Offerings</h3>
<p>You may not use the Assets to create, market, or sell a Competitive Offering. In particular, you may not substantially reproduce the structure, sequence, organization, or core content of the Assets in a competing library, template pack, or course that you offer to third parties.</p>
<h3 id="ai-training-restriction">4.6 AI Training restriction</h3>
<p>You may not use the Assets for AI Training. You may not upload, submit, or otherwise make the Assets available to any machine learning or AI system in a manner that would cause that system to memorize, reproduce, or otherwise derive the Assets (or substantial portions of them).</p>
<h3 id="no-unlawful-or-harmful-use">4.7 No unlawful or harmful use</h3>
<p>You may not use the Assets for any unlawful purpose or in connection with any product or service that violates applicable law or third-party rights.</p>
<h3 id="no-misrepresentation-of-authorship">4.8 No misrepresentation of authorship</h3>
<p>You may represent your Projects as your own work, but you may not claim authorship of the Assets themselves or remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary notices or credit lines included with the Assets, except as permitted in accompanying documentation.</p>
<h3 id="reservation-of-rights">4.9 Reservation of rights</h3>
<p>The Assets are licensed, not sold. All rights in and to the Assets that are not expressly granted to you in this EULA are reserved by Licensor and its licensors.</p>
<h2 id="contractor--team-access">5. Contractor &amp; Team Access</h2>
<p>You may allow your employees and individual contractors (“<strong>Authorized Users</strong>”) to access and use the Assets solely on your behalf and exclusively for your Projects, provided that:</p>
<ul>
<li>each Authorized User is bound in writing to terms that are at least as protective of the Assets as this EULA; and</li>
<li>you remain fully responsible and liable for all acts and omissions of Authorized Users in connection with the Assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>You must ensure that each contractor promptly deletes all copies of the Assets in their possession or control upon completion of their work for you or upon your request. Licensor may require written confirmation that such deletion has occurred.</p>
<h2 id="fees-delivery--refunds">6. Fees, Delivery &amp; Refunds</h2>
<h3 id="fees">6.1 Fees</h3>
<p>Fees, taxes, and payment terms are as stated at the point of sale or in the ordering document. You agree to pay all amounts due in the currency and payment method specified. Access to Assets may be suspended or terminated if payment is not received when due.</p>
<h3 id="delivery-and-access">6.2 Delivery and access</h3>
<p>Unless otherwise stated, Assets are delivered electronically (for example, by download link, account access, or streaming) promptly after purchase. Delivery times are approximate and may depend on factors outside Licensor’s control.</p>
<h3 id="refunds-consumer-rights">6.3 Refunds; consumer rights</h3>
<p>Except as required by applicable law or as expressly stated in a written refund policy provided by Licensor for a particular product, <strong>all sales are final and non-refundable.</strong></p>
<p>Nothing in this EULA is intended to exclude or limit any non-waivable statutory rights that apply to a Consumer under applicable law. If an End User qualifies as a Consumer in a jurisdiction that provides mandatory withdrawal or cooling-off rights for digital content, Licensor will comply with any non-waivable requirements.</p>
<h2 id="intellectual-property">7. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>The Assets are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and international treaties. As between you and Licensor, Licensor (and its licensors, if any) owns all rights, title, and interest in and to the Assets, including all copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights therein.</p>
<p>No ownership rights are transferred to you under this EULA. You receive only the limited license rights expressly granted in Section 3.</p>
<h2 id="backups">8. Backups</h2>
<p>You may create a reasonable number of backup or archival copies of the Assets solely for disaster recovery, continuity, and archival purposes. All such copies remain subject to this EULA and may not be distributed or used for any other purpose.</p>
<h2 id="reverse-engineering">9. Reverse Engineering</h2>
<p>You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any executable or compiled components of the Assets, except to the limited extent that applicable law expressly permits such activity notwithstanding a contractual prohibition. If such law applies, you must first request the relevant interoperability information from Licensor and may only use any information obtained through reverse engineering for the purpose permitted by that law.</p>
<h2 id="updates--support">10. Updates &amp; Support</h2>
<p>Licensor may, but is not obligated to, provide updates, revisions, supplements, or replacements for the Assets (“<strong>Updates</strong>”). Any Updates that Licensor makes available to you will be considered part of the Assets and will be subject to this EULA, unless Updates are accompanied by a separate license, in which case that license will govern to the extent of any conflict.</p>
<p>Licensor has no obligation to provide technical support, maintenance, or consulting services for the Assets unless a separate written support or services agreement is in place.</p>
<h2 id="compliance--export">11. Compliance &amp; Export</h2>
<p>You must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in connection with your use of the Assets, including export, sanctions, and data protection laws. You represent that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any country or jurisdiction that is subject to comprehensive sanctions or embargoes, and that you are not identified on any applicable government restricted-party list.</p>
<p>You may not export, re-export, or transfer the Assets in violation of any applicable export control or sanctions laws.</p>
<h2 id="disclaimer-of-warranties">12. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Assets and any related documentation or services are provided on an “<strong>AS IS</strong>” and “<strong>AS AVAILABLE</strong>” basis, with all faults and without any warranty of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory.</p>
<p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Licensor disclaims all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement, and any warranties arising out of course of dealing, usage, or trade. Licensor does not warrant that the Assets will be error-free, secure, or uninterrupted, or that any defects will be corrected.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties. To the extent that applicable law does not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, the above exclusions shall apply to you only to the fullest extent permitted by that law.</p>
<h2 id="limitation-of-liability">13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will Licensor be liable for any:</p>
<ul>
<li>indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages; or</li>
<li>loss of profits, revenue, business, goodwill, or data,</li>
</ul>
<p>arising out of or relating to this EULA or the use of or inability to use the Assets, even if Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if a remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Licensor’s total aggregate liability for all claims arising out of or relating to this EULA or the Assets, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, shall be limited to the amount actually paid by you to Licensor for the specific Asset giving rise to the claim during the six (6) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations of liability for certain types of damages, such as death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct. Nothing in this EULA is intended to exclude or limit liability where such exclusion or limitation is not permitted by applicable law.</p>
<h2 id="indemnification">14. Indemnification</h2>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Licensor and its officers, directors, employees, agents, and affiliates from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>your use of the Assets in violation of this EULA or applicable law; or</li>
<li>any Project or other product or service you develop, market, or provide that incorporates or relies on the Assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Licensor reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which case you agree to cooperate with Licensor’s defense of such claim.</p>
<h2 id="term--termination">15. Term &amp; Termination</h2>
<p>This EULA becomes effective when you first accept it or download, access, install, or use the Assets, and continues until terminated as set forth in this Section.</p>
<h3 id="termination-by-licensor">15.1 Termination by Licensor</h3>
<p>Licensor may terminate this EULA, in whole or in part, immediately upon notice to you if you materially breach any provision of this EULA and, where the breach is capable of cure, fail to cure such breach within ten (10) days after receiving written notice describing the breach.</p>
<h3 id="termination-by-you">15.2 Termination by You</h3>
<p>You may terminate this EULA at any time by permanently ceasing all use of the Assets and deleting all copies of the Assets in your possession or control.</p>
<h3 id="effect-of-termination">15.3 Effect of termination</h3>
<p>Upon termination of this EULA for any reason:</p>
<ul>
<li>all license rights granted to you under this EULA will immediately cease; and</li>
<li>you must promptly cease all use of the Assets and delete all copies of the Assets (including backups and modified versions) in your possession or control.</li>
</ul>
<p>Termination will not entitle you to any refund of fees already paid, except to the limited extent required by applicable law.</p>
<p>Sections that by their nature should survive termination (including but not limited to Sections 2, 4, 7, 11–17) shall survive any termination of this EULA.</p>
<h2 id="governing-law--dispute-resolution">16. Governing Law &amp; Dispute Resolution</h2>
<h3 id="governing-law">16.1 Governing law</h3>
<p>This EULA and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, U.S.A., without giving effect to its conflict-of-law principles, <strong>except</strong> that if you are a Consumer and your mandatory local consumer protection laws require the application of the law of your country of residence, then that law will apply to the extent required.</p>
<h3 id="binding-arbitration-waiver-of-jury-trial">16.2 Binding arbitration; waiver of jury trial</h3>
<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this EULA, the Assets, or your relationship with Licensor (whether arising in contract, tort, statute, or otherwise) (“<strong>Dispute</strong>”) shall be resolved by <strong>binding arbitration</strong> administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect.</p>
<p>The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, in English, with the seat of arbitration in Dallas, Texas, U.S.A. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. <strong>Each party irrevocably waives any right to a jury trial in any court proceeding relating to any Dispute to the extent permitted by law.</strong></p>
<h3 id="class-and-representative-action-waiver">16.3 Class and representative action waiver</h3>
<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, all Disputes shall be conducted on an individual basis only and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. You and Licensor each agree that you may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, or representative proceeding.</p>
<h3 id="exceptions-small-claims-injunctive-relief">16.4 Exceptions; small claims; injunctive relief</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding Sections 16.2 and 16.3, each party may:</p>
<ul>
<li>seek temporary or preliminary injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its confidential information or intellectual property rights; and</li>
<li>bring an individual action in a small-claims court that has jurisdiction over the claim and the parties, instead of proceeding in arbitration, if the claim qualifies.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="non-application-where-prohibited">16.5 Non-application where prohibited</h3>
<p>If you are a Consumer and the mandatory laws of your country of residence do not permit mandatory arbitration or class action waivers for certain types of disputes, then the arbitration and class action waiver provisions in this Section 16 may not apply to you to that extent. In such cases, disputes shall instead be resolved by the competent courts of your country of residence, without prejudice to any mandatory rights you may have to bring claims in other forums.</p>
<h2 id="general-terms">17. General Terms</h2>
<h3 id="changes-to-this-eula">17.1 Changes to this EULA</h3>
<p>Licensor may update this EULA from time to time. The version in effect at the time you purchase or first access particular Assets will apply to those Assets, unless you expressly agree to a later version. If Licensor makes material changes, it will provide notice by reasonable means (for example, by updating the effective date at the top of this EULA or by notice in your account interface).</p>
<h3 id="assignment">17.2 Assignment</h3>
<p>You may not assign or transfer this EULA, or any of your rights or obligations under it, without Licensor’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment without such consent will be void. Licensor may assign this EULA without restriction, including to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of assets.</p>
<h3 id="severability">17.3 Severability</h3>
<p>If any provision of this EULA is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
<h3 id="no-waiver">17.4 No waiver</h3>
<p>A failure or delay by either party to exercise any right or remedy under this EULA will not constitute a waiver of that right or remedy, and no waiver will be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party.</p>
<h3 id="entire-agreement">17.5 Entire agreement</h3>
<p>This EULA, together with any order, invoice, or written policy expressly referenced herein, constitutes the entire agreement between you and Licensor with respect to the Assets and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, whether written or oral, relating to the Assets.</p>
